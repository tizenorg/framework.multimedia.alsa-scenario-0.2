File locations
==============

Each sound card will have a master file describing it's supported scenarios.
This file does not describe the control settings for each scenario, but does
describe control aliases and control setting files.

The master scenario file will be /etc/alsa/scenario/card_name.conf

The scenario control descriptors for "card_name" will be in
/etc/alsa/scenario/card_name/

Scenario Generation
===================

The scenario master file needs to be hand written for each sound card.
An example can be found in examples/default.conf

The scenario control descriptor file can be generated as follows.

1. Use alsamixer, amixer, etc to adjust sound card control to desired values.
2. Dump sound card values with examples/scndump "scndump card_name > scenario"
3. Copy scenario file to /etc/alsa/scenario/card_name/
